		<p>MWBModel allows to read MySQL Workbench files. 
		Most users will use the {@link com.github.upachler.mwbmodel.Loader} class to load 
		MWB files. </p>

		<p>Some expert users might be interested in the underlying
		runtime model, which is a partial Java implementation of
		the GRT runtime system of MySQL Workbench. MWB files are 
		serializations of GRT object graphs.</p>

		<p>The type definitions 
		used by the GRT loader infrastructure, which actually represent
		the C/C++ structs of MySQL Workbench's data structures, such as
		tables, columns, etc. can be found in the 
		<a href='{@docRoot}com/github/upachler/mwbmodel/model/package-summary.html'>com.github.upachler.mwbmodel.model</a>
		package.</p>

		<p>The low-level GRT unmarshalling is performed using the 
		{@link com.github.upachler.mwbmodel.grt.GrtUnmarshaller} class.</p>
